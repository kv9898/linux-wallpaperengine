# 🖼️ Linux Wallpaper Engine

Bring **Wallpaper Engine**-style live wallpapers to Linux! This project allows you to run animated wallpapers from Steam's Wallpaper Engine right on your desktop.

> This is a fork of [Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine](https://github.com/Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine) with added **GNOME/Wayland support** via a companion GNOME Shell extension.

---

## 🐧 Arch Linux Users

You can install this directly from the AUR using your favorite AUR helper:

```bash
yay -S linux-wallpaperengine-git
```

**Note:** You'll still need assets from the official Wallpaper Engine (via Steam). See below for details.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Get Wallpaper Engine Assets

You **must own and install Wallpaper Engine** via Steam. This provides the required assets used by many backgrounds.

Right now the application will automatically detect everything for you as long as the official Wallpaper Engine is installed
in one of these locations:

```
~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common
~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common
~/snap/steam/common/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common
```

> ✅ If Wallpaper Engine is installed in one of these paths, the assets will be detected automatically!

---

#### ❗ If Assets Aren't Found Automatically

If the assets are not detected automatically, you'll see a message like this:
```
Cannot find a valid assets folder, resolved to 'assets'
```

You can copy the `assets` folder manually:

1. In Steam, right-click **Wallpaper Engine** → **Manage** → **Browse local files**
2. Copy the `assets` folder
3. Paste it into the same folder where the `linux-wallpaperengine` binary is located (build/output if you followed the build instructions)

Another option is to specify the path manually with the `--assets-dir` option, like this:
```bash
linux-wallpaperengine --assets-dir /path/to/assets
```
---

### 2. Build from Source

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kv9898/linux-wallpaperengine.git
cd linux-wallpaperengine
```

Build it:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE='Release' ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

Once the build process is finished, this should create a new `output` folder containing the app and all the required
support files to run.

---

## 🧪 Usage

Basic syntax:

```bash
linux-wallpaperengine [options] <background_id or path>
```

You can use either:
- A Steam Workshop ID (e.g. `1845706469`)
- A path to a background folder

### What about a GUI?

Implementing a GUI is out of scope for now.
There's a few developers that decided to focus on this and created their own.
If you're one of those developers, feel free to open an issue to get your project included here!

---

### 💡 Examples

#### Run a background by ID
```bash
linux-wallpaperengine 1845706469
```

#### Run a background from a folder
```bash
linux-wallpaperengine ~/backgrounds/1845706469/
```

#### Assign backgrounds to screens with scaling
```bash
linux-wallpaperengine \
  --scaling stretch --screen-root eDP-1 --bg 2667198601 \
  --scaling fill --screen-root HDMI-1 --bg 2667198602
```

#### Stretch one wallpaper across multiple monitors
```bash
linux-wallpaperengine \
  --scaling fill --screen-span HDMI-A-1,DP-2,DP-3 --bg 1845706469
```

#### Run in a window
```bash
linux-wallpaperengine --window 0x0x1280x720 1845706469
```

#### Limit FPS to save power
```bash
linux-wallpaperengine --fps 30 1845706469
```

#### Take a screenshot
```bash
linux-wallpaperengine --screenshot ~/wallpaper.png 1845706469
```

#### View and change properties
```bash
linux-wallpaperengine --list-properties 2370927443
```

Any of these values can be modified with the --set-property switch. Say you want to enable the bloom in this background, you would do so like this:
```bash
linux-wallpaperengine --set-property bloom=1 2370927443
```

## 🖥️ GNOME / Wayland Support

GNOME's Mutter compositor does **not** support the `wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1` protocol used by the standard Wayland driver. This fork adds GNOME support through a two-part system:

### Architecture

1. **C++ renderer** (`--gnome` flag) — creates standard Wayland windows (xdg-shell) with encoded window titles instead of wlr-layer-shell surfaces
2. **GNOME Shell extension** (`gnome-extension/`) — discovers renderer windows, creates `Clutter.Clone` actors, and injects them into the desktop background behind your icons

The approach is inspired by [gnome-ext-hanabi](https://github.com/jeffshee/gnome-ext-hanabi). For technical details, see the extension's [README](gnome-extension/README.md).

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Install the extension
ln -s $(pwd)/gnome-extension ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/linux-wallpaperengine@github.io

# 2. Restart GNOME Shell

# 3. Enable the extension
gnome-extensions enable linux-wallpaperengine@github.io
```

### Usage

Find your monitor name first:

```bash
ls /sys/class/drm/ | grep -E '^card[0-9]+-[A-Z]' | sed 's/card[0-9]*-//'
```

Then run with `--gnome`:

```bash
# Single screen
linux-wallpaperengine --gnome --screen-root eDP-1 --bg 1845706469

# Multiple screens
linux-wallpaperengine --gnome \
  --screen-root HDMI-1 --bg 1845706469 \
  --screen-root eDP-1 --bg 2667198601
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Extension not loading**: check `journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep lwpe`
- **"Not compatible" warning**: run `gnome-shell --version` and add your version to `gnome-extension/metadata.json` if needed, then restart the shell
- **Static wallpaper showing**: the extension may need re-enabling — `gnome-extensions disable linux-wallpaperengine@github.io && gnome-extensions enable linux-wallpaperengine@github.io`

---

## 🧪 Wayland & X11 Support

- **Wayland (wlroots)**: Works with compositors that support `wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1` (Sway, Hyprland, River, Wayfire, etc.). Uses `xdg-output-unstable-v1` for accurate monitor positioning.
- **Wayland (GNOME)**: Use `--gnome` flag with the companion GNOME Shell extension (see above).
- **X11**: Requires XRandr. Use `--screen-root <screen_name>` (as shown in `xrandr`).

> ⚠ For X11 users: Currently doesn't work if a compositor or desktop environment (e.g. GNOME, KDE, Nautilus) is drawing the background.

---

## 🪲 Common issues

### Black screen when setting as screen's background
This can be caused by a few different things depending on your environment and setup.

### X11
Common symptom of a compositor drawing to the background which prevents Wallpaper Engine from being properly visible.
The only solution currently is disabling the compositor so Wallpaper Engine can properly draw on the screen

### NVIDIA
Some users have had issues with GLFW initialization and other OpenGL errors. These are generally something that's
worth reporting in the issues. Sometimes adding this variable when running Wallpaper Engine helps and/or solves
the issue:
```bash
__GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=0 linux-wallpaperengine
```

We'll be looking at improving this in the future, but for now it can be a useful workaround.
